Nanny's Window
==============

A Flash-based interactive learning tool for kids that features a nanny who tells them about various things that are found in one's home. It also features a quiz where kids can test whatever they have learnt so far.

The tool was developed as an entry for Softek - COFAS 2009, organised by City Montessori School (CMS), Lucknow
